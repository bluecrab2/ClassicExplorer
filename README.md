# ClassicExplorer
This program reads all the information from Pre-Classic or Classic Minecraft files and displays them in a folder tree similar to [NBTExplorer](https://github.com/jaquadro/NBTExplorer/releases). The specific version range is rd-132211 (first version of Minecraft that has been released) to Classic 0.30 (last classic version). Indev and later versions use NBT format and so can be read with NBTExplorer.

## Installation
ClassicExplorer requires a Java version 8 or later to run. The jar should run by double-clicking it, or you can run it through the command prompt with the command `java -jar ClassicExplorer.jar` in its directory.
